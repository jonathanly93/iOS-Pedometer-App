### Fitness App: Step Counter

The app uses core motion to detect movement to increase "step counter".


The application has a title page which leads to a tab bar controller. The tab bar consist of the pedometer and a table view that
list the results. On the pedometer page near the top, there is an info button that takes you to the info view. You can reset
data and set up dummy data in the results.

To test the app, you will need to connect to a phone to test the step counter. Just connect the phone and start shaking the
phone and the counter should go up. The pace and avg pace will adjust acording to how much steps is taken and the results
will be saved and shown on the results tab when you stop the pedometer. Initially I planned on making a chart to compare
the results of each run with the avg results of all runs, but I did not have enough time to complete.
